I am currently pursuing my graduate studies in Computational and Applied Mathematics at Colorado School of Mines. With a background in global seismology and mathematics, I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of data compression, numerical analysis, and computational geophysics. My academic journey is driven by a relentless curiosity to unravel the complexities of seismic data and devise innovative solutions to enhance processing workflows.
