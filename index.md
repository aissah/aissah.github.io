I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computational and Applied Mathematics at Colorado School of Mines. With a background in global seismology and mathematics, I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of data compression, numerical analysis, and computational geophysics. My academic journey is driven by a relentless curiosity to unravel the complexities of seismic data and devise innovative solutions to enhance processing workflows.

Some grants that have funded my PhD work so far include: [mine seismicity](https://caserm.mines.edu/research-projects/), [permafrost thaw monitoring and remote large-scale seismic data mananagement](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2034366&HistoricalAwards=false), [scalable algorithms for passive seismic data](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2046387&HistoricalAwards=false), and the [Distributed Acoustic Sensing Data Analysis Ecosystem](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2148614)

**Get in Touch:** 
I'm always eager to connect with fellow researchers, collaborators, and enthusiasts passionate about numerical analysis, uncertainty quantification, and computational geoscience. Whether you have a question, a collaboration proposal, or just want to chat about compressing seismic data, feel free to reach out! An immediate goal that may be a source of collaboration is evaluating/interpreting the errors introduced by machine learning methods applied in the compression of siesmic data. **If you have a pre-trained module I can use, I would be happy to collaborate.**
